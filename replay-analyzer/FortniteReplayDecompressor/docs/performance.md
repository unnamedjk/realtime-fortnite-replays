Performance
=====

With the [2.0.0](https://github.com/Shiqan/FortniteReplayDecompressor/releases/tag/2.0.0) release, performance is down to less than a second for each replay. Average is about 300 to 500 ms for most replays.

## Scotty, I need more power
If you want to have an average of less than 100 ms per replay, check out [SL-x-TnT](https://github.com/SL-x-TnT) fork.
